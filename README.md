# Audio-Deep-Fake-Detection
## Introduction:
   In today's AI-driven world, synthetic speech technology has become incredibly advanced, making it harder than ever to tell real voices apart from deepfake audio. While this innovation has its benefitsâ€”like improving accessibility and creating realistic virtual assistantsâ€”it also comes with serious risks. Deepfake audio can be misused for misinformation, scams, and even identity theft, posing a major challenge in digital security.

This project is dedicated to tackling that challenge by exploring and implementing cutting-edge methods to detect AI-generated speech. From traditional techniques that analyze audio features like MFCCs and spectral properties to deep learning models that automatically learn patterns from raw sound, this repository dives deep into multiple detection strategies.

## Research & Selection:
 After carefully reviewing the *Audio-Deepfake-Detection* GitHub repositoryâ€”a well-curated collection of research papers and resources on detecting audio deepfakesâ€”Iâ€™ve identified three promising approaches that align with our needs. Each method offers unique strengths and trade-offs in distinguishing real from AI-generated speech.
1.  ### Handcrafted Feature-Based Detection :-
ðŸ”¹ How It Works: This approach relies on manually engineered features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), and spectral features to capture key characteristics of an audio signal.  

ðŸ”¹ Performance & Benefits: Studies show that handcrafted features can effectively differentiate real and fake audio, especially in controlled environments. They are computationally efficient, making them well-suited for real-time detection. Additionally, their interpretability helps us understand what distinguishes genuine speech from deepfake audio.  

ðŸ”¹ Limitations: Since this method depends on predefined features, it may struggle to adapt to more sophisticated or evolving deepfake techniques, potentially reducing its effectiveness over time.  

2. ### Hybrid Feature-Based Detection:- 
ðŸ”¹ How It Works: This technique combines handcrafted features with deep learning-based features, leveraging the best of both worlds for improved detection accuracy.  

ðŸ”¹ Performance & Benefits: Research indicates that hybrid models tend to outperform approaches that rely solely on either handcrafted or deep learning-derived features. They achieve higher accuracy and lower false positive rates, making them more reliable across various deepfake audio types.  

ðŸ”¹ Limitations: The added complexity increases computational demands, which could be a drawback for real-time applications where processing speed is critical.  

3. ### End-to-End Deepfake Detection:-
ðŸ”¹ How It Works: Instead of manually extracting features, this method uses deep neural networks to automatically learn audio patterns directly from raw data.  

ðŸ”¹ Performance & Benefits: End-to-end models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in deepfake detection benchmarks. Their ability to learn complex patterns makes them highly adaptable to different deepfake techniques, improving real-world detection capabilities.  

ðŸ”¹ Limitations: These models require significant computational resources and large labeled datasets for training, which can be a challenge in resource-limited environments.  

Each of these approaches provides valuable insights into real-time deepfake audio detection. While handcrafted features offer efficiency, hybrid models provide balance, and end-to-end methods excel in adaptability, the best choice depends on our specific requirements and constraints.

## Implementation :
   These are the three forgery based detection models, Here I used to select the Hybrid model to continue the project. 
### 1. Why Hybrid Feature-Based Detection?
After considering different approaches, Iâ€™ve decided to go with Hybrid Feature-Based Forgery Detection for several reasons:

 #### ðŸ”¹ Best of both worlds:
 This approach blends handcrafted audio features (like MFCCs) with deep learning-extracted features, ensuring both interpretability and adaptability.

 #### ðŸ”¹ More robust to evolving deepfake techniques:
 Unlike purely handcrafted methods, hybrid models can adapt better to new deepfake generation strategies.

#### ðŸ”¹ Balanced computational cost: 
While deep learning models offer high accuracy, they require significant resources. The hybrid approach strikes a good balance between performance and efficiency, making it more practical for real-time detection.
### 2. How Does It Compare to Other Approaches?

| **Criteria** | **Handcrafted Features** | **Hybrid (Selected Approach)** | **End-to-End Deep Learning** |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **How Features Are Extracted** | Manually designed (e.g., MFCC, LPC) | Combination of manual & deep learning features | Learned directly from raw audio |
| **Interpretability** | High â€“ easy to analyze | Moderate â€“ mix of explainable & learned features | Low â€“ features are learned implicitly |
| **Detection Accuracy** | Moderate | High | Very High |
| **Computational Cost** | Low â€“ lightweight processing | Moderate â€“ requires some deep learning | High â€“ needs extensive processing power |
| **Adaptability to New Deepfake Techniques** | Low â€“ struggles with unseen manipulations | High â€“ adapts to a variety of attacks | Very High â€“ learns from diverse patterns |
| **Real-Time Feasibility** | High â€“ very fast | Moderate to High â€“ some latency | Low â€“ requires significant resources |

### 3. Existing Code & Model Selection
#### ðŸ”¹ Where is the code coming from?

The Audio Deepfake Detection GitHub repo contains several repositories with existing models.

Iâ€™ll be working with a **PyTorch-based hybrid model** that combines **MFCC feature** extraction with a  **CNN-BiLSTM** architecture.

#### ðŸ”¹ How will it be implemented?

Everything will be set up in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing for easy experimentation and visualization.

### 4.Model Architecture:

This is the model Architecture Which is Used to detect the real or fake voices of the audio speech datasets. 
 #### 1. MFCC:
  MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) is a widely used feature extraction technique in audio deepfake detection, helping to identify subtle differences between real and AI-generated speech. It works by transforming the audio signal into a set of coefficients that represent its spectral characteristics, mimicking how the human ear perceives sound. By emphasizing lower frequencies and reducing irrelevant noise, MFCC captures key speech features, making it useful for detecting unnatural patterns or distortions in deepfake audio. When combined with deep learning models, it enhances accuracy by providing both handcrafted and automatically extracted features, improving detection reliability.
  The output of MFCC is like A 2D matrix (time Ã— MFCC coefficients), which acts like an image input for CNN.
 #### 2. Working of CNN: 
 - The MFCC matrix is treated as an image (frequency vs. time).

  - Convolutional layers extract local patterns. It Reduces noise and irrelevant variations through convolutional layers. That is also a reason to select this model.

- Pooling layers(MAX-POOL,AVG POOL) downsample the features for computational efficiency.

- The output is a compact feature map that represents the audio input which is then flatten and acts as a sequence.

##### ðŸ”¹ Output: 
A sequence of feature embeddings for each time step.
   #### 3. Working of BiLSTM RNN: 
   Speech has sequential dependencies. CNN alone doesnâ€™t capture long-term temporal relationships. So, We can use the LSTM RNN, But Standard LSTM(Long-Short Term Memory) processes only past context may miss future dependencies. BiLSTM processes both past & future context, improving speech recognition.
- Takes CNN feature embeddings as input.
- Processes the sequence forward & backward.
- Captures time-dependent patterns to understand deepfake cues.
- Outputs a final vector representation for classification.

ðŸ”¹ Output: A compressed sequence representation with past & future dependencies.
#### 3. Fully Connected Layer and Classification:
  A high dimensional sequence is the output of Bidirectional LSTM RNN. So The final BiLSTM output is passed to a fully connected (FC) layer. This is a Neural Network where we use the backpropagation and optimizers to adjust the weight and bias using the loss function.
  A softmax activation predicts real (0) or fake (1).
